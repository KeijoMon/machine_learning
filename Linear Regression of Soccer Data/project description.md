# Analysis of Soccer Player Data

This data analysis and machine learning project focuses on soccer data and tries to predict the goal score of players of different positions. We use simple multi-dimensional linear regression for the task and do a lot of visualization of the dataset.  

Using the linear model we determine which features affect the most to the goal score (linear coefficients of the different features). We also analyze the results of our model and the whole project from a practical point of view.
