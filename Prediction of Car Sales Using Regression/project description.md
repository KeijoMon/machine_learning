# Analysis of Car Sales Data

This project uses data of sold used cars (in US) to train machine learning models. These models are then used to make predictions for the prices of cars and sales times of cars. In real life this kind of project could be used, for example, by a used car sales chain operating in United States which aims to improve its trading operations and optimize it inventory using data analytics and machine learning. 

The goal is also to identify the factors that influence the price and sales duration of used vehicles and to obtain information about the features which affect the most to the prices and the sales times of used vehicles. This will enable the car retailer to better understand the factors influencing vehicle prices and sales durations, and to gain insights into the market's preferences for different vehicle types and manufacturers. By doing so, the dealership can optimize its inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies to improve its overall trading operations and market competitiveness.
