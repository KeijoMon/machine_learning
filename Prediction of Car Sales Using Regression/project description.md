# Analysis of Car Sales Data

This machine learning project uses data of sold used cars (in US) to train two simple machine learning models. These models are then used to make predictions for the prices and sales times of used cars. The goal is also to identify the factors that influence the most to the price and sales duration of used vehicles.

We use two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. We also compare the results and accuracy of the models. We conclude that the Random Forest Regression performs better on the data, but is much slower to train than the Linear Regression model.
