# Classification and Regression for Astronomical Objects

This machine learning project tries to classify three different astronomical objects (galaxies, quasars and stars) based on their photometric measurements. Furthermore, we try to determine the redshift of galaxies and quasars based on their photometric measurements. 

Both the classification and regression problems are solved using deep learning and neural networks. We also discuss the relevance and accuracy of our results.
