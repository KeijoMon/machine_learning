# Classification and Regression for Astronomical Objects

This deep learning project tries to classify three different astronomical objects (galaxies, quasars and stars) based on their photometric measurements. Furthermore, we try to determine the (photometric) redshift of galaxies and quasars from their photometric properties. Both the classification and regression problems are solved using deep learning and neural networks.
