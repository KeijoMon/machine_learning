# Classification of Female and Male Voices

This project uses several machine learning models to classify female and male voices from voice data. We use the following machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.

After preprocessing the dataset the models perform exceptionally well in the test data (accuracies in the range 97.7%-99.3% and AUC values in the range 0.99-1.00). We have included only three input voice features in the classification task: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal (meanfun), interquantile range (IQR) and spectral flatness (sfm).
