# Machine Learning and Data Analysis

This repository contains miscellaneous data analysis and machine learning projects. At the moment, the topics include:

1. Classification and regression used in astronomical data to classify and predict redshifts of galaxies, quasars and stars. This is done by using Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

2. Regression used in car sales data to predict prices and sales times of used cars. This is done by using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. 

3. Classification used in the Titanic dataset to predict the survivors. This is done by using k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Classifier.

4. Regression used in Soccer Player Data to predict the goals scored by players. This is done by using Linear Regression.

5. Classification used in voice data to predict the gender (female or male). This is done by several different machine learning algorithms.
