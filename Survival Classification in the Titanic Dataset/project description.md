# Prediction of Survivors in the Titanic Dataset

This data analysis and machine learning project uses two simple machine learning models to classify survivors (binary classification) in the Titanic dataset. We use the k-Nearest Neighbors model and the Random Forest Classifier. 

We compare the results and accuracy of the models and conclude that they both perform equally well on our preprocessed Titanic data. We also infer the most important features which affect the survival from the dramatic accident.
